## Overview
I enrolled in Brad Traversy's course in udemy where he teaches the **MERN** stack. My goal is to generally learn **Express** and **Mongodb** as I previously had an experience in **React**. I used Brad's course only as a guide and to familiarize myself with express. Furthermore, since I'm a **typescript** fan, I used it instead of **javascript**.

## Packages used
- express-validator - For input validation
- mongoose - For Mongodb
- jsonwebtoken - For jwt
